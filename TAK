P1: So, Chemotherape is actually over, you know, do to .......Companys develop Chemotherape Agents. Except improvement. You can see that, even from very very beginning, that nitrogen mustard was used. it was not replacement, nitrogen mustard was found by Alexander to extrang the ling float of unfourturenate people was explosed.and so Later on gumer treatment was desided to treat Patient, so the resional was always been there.   
P2: And of cause the discovery of Oncogenes is 1936, there was exited the oncogenes is definately the target. Because oncogenes cause cancer. And therefore, it's the horse. If you shoot the horse, you stop the cart. That is the reshionality. Again we have reshinality.      
P3: Today, 100,000 patients Sequenced, there are no new,  are strugling for dedicates. it is time to go back, and think about what was really cause this cancer.
P4: Cancer, like many other metabolic 

So. Chemotherapy. Is actually. Over. The. Previous. It does seem. Very. Very good to me. That's. Nice. Best. Use. It was not a place. Yes. It was. I had a soft. Spring. It. Starts. Off. I'm fortunate. It's. So. Later on. Patients. So the rationale. Is always. To discover. In 1976. It was decided that operation. Happens. Because. Of National Prostate Cancer. And then. It.
 Is a horse. You should. Also stop to. Count. The. Rest. We have. Now. Today. I have a thousand reasons secrets. There. Are no real major outages. And the. Remaining ones. Like the last. Days. Max. Is struggling. Accidents. It's time. To go back. And think. About what. We need. To losses. Against. Cancer. I many of the past. Is caused by the. Imbalance. I have to watch. The game in the game.
 That is due. To in many. Cases as in the case of cancer. That is due. To. Medical. Attention. As. Soon as. The presidency is. The. Damage. There is also. A. Cowardice. Which. Is. This. And. The immune system. Which of course. Is. Called. 1966. You've got a lot of ways. And said we will find out about. The conclusion that it was not caused by viruses not ice ages. It's possible. That.
 The. Inability. Of the. Cancer cells. Sets a standard. That. That happens to be suitable. I think Julie. Of all the mutations that. I use. Is the most collected. Very interesting. We get to obsess about genetics. And.
Have twenty seven hundred genes. They. All. In. Metabolism. The number of disease severe. Will have. Approximately 60 Palestinian patients. In the United States and no. And. We decided to just. Look at it. With. Implementation. Into this particular. Situation. You just see. It. A. GBM. What is important is. The inhibitor. That. Edge is made. From. A piece of. Paper. And. In seven years. And the. Drug were approved.
 And what is amazing is. That it has. Not only extended survival. As you can see here. This. From. Us. And a company. Recently concluded. Suggests. That. Reversing. The metabolism state of. The cancer cell differentiates. This is not a simple case. Similarly DNA repair. This is in my pocket. This is. Very very unfair mean. Something. Should. Know too much about this. Because this. Kind of activity that. Happens. In. Cancer cells in general mentally unstable would make it.
 Impossible to escape. So they fight for. So.
