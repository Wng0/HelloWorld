2019-7-17 [Monero] Fork Monero.   
2019-7-24 [Monero] Sumsun notebook with GPU, build Monero High Temperature, shut down.  
2019-7-24 [Monero] Desktop Ubuntu run Monero-Wallet-GUI, 76H/S.   
2019-7-25-28 Holiday.   
2019-7-30 [Ubuntu] Sumsun notbook high temperature shutdown. Need AMDGUPDriver, TLP power manager, Laptop-mode.   
2019-7-30 [Monero] Dell notebook Ubuntu run Monero-Wallet-GUI, 23H/S. 75C       
2019-7-31 [Ethereum] Windows try Go-Ehereum cli.    
2019-8-2  [Monero] Sumsung run Monero-Wallet-GUI, 16H/S.78C. 
2019-8-3  [Monero] Run Monero-Wallet-GUI on 315PC. Down load BlockChain very slow. after one week, start to mine, only 13H/S.  
2019-8-9  [Monero] Start to mine XMR on F2Pool. using XMRig-cpu on Sumsung, 24H/S. using XMRrig-cpu on Dell notebook, 50H/S. compare to the Monero-wallet-GUI, the eficiency improved 100%. Guess for Desktop CPU, will be 150H/S. but not try. as no meaning, that lower than GPU (Highest, GTX660 300h/S, GTX1060 600h/S).            
2019-8-10 [Monero] Mine XMR by GTX 660. using XMRig-Nvdia, 100H/S. by XMR-stak, 120H/S. 315CPU, very low, only 9H/S.       
2019-8-11 [Monero] Mine XMR by GTX 1060, using XMR-stak, 400H/S, CPU 100H/S, for low temperature, stop CPU mining.  
2019-8-13 [Monero] Optimize XMR-stak config, improve the GTX 1060, from 400H/S to 450H/S. 
2019-8-14 [Monero] Optimize XMR-stak config on Sumsung, but no change, CPU 8H/S, GPU 16H/S. because the Memory used by CPU very less, only 300m. Then change to XMRig, but AMD version cannot run. optimize XMRig-CPU, 24H/S. 
2019-8-15 [Ethereum] After study, for XMR, Nvidia have less efficient than AMD (GTX1060 600H/S, RX580 900H/S), but for ETH, they are the same. then I try to mine ETH on my GTX 1060 by official miner soft, Ethminer, 20MH/S.      
2019-8-16 [Ethereum] After calculation, ETH, ETC, XMR.... have the same mining efficiet, very fair. then Mining ETC will be the fastest way for me. because the Price is low, then Less miner, more mining result, fast pay by pool.          
2019-8-16 [Ethereum Classic] using official miner soft, Ethminer to mine ETC by GTX 1060.       
2019-8-17 [Ethereum Classic] try Ethminer on GTX660, can not run, lack of Memory.    
2019-8-17 [Monero] Optimize XMR-stak config, improve the GTX 660, from 120H/S to 200H/S.   
2019-8-17 [Ethereum Classic] Ethminer, after around 3-4 hours, it stoped. not stable. 
2019-8-18 [Ethereum Classic] using Claymore to mine ETC. very stable, 20MH/S.    
2019-8-20 [Ethereum Classic] Mine the first 0.1ETC. But can not check the balane in my ETC cli.   
2019-8-21 [Ethereum Classic] After fast systh mode finished, auto disable and change to "import". then the account balance show my value 0.1ETC.
2019-8-28 [Market] Huobi, one of the top3 market in China. BitMex, one of the biggest in world. Binance, one of the top 3 in China. but can not connect.    

[Bitcoin] The first Coin from 2008.   
[Bitcoin Cash] the first branch from Bitcoin by 2017. Github BitcoinABC. The branch coins have less meanning, because everyone can create a new branch from bitcoin. Replaceable. Easy to be attacked. the only use is as testChain.    
[LiteCoin] the first Copy coin from Bitcoin by 2011. Github Litecoin. The copy coins have less meaning, because everyone can create a new copy from Bitcoin.Replaceable. Easy to be attacked. the only use is as testChain.         
[Ethereum] The BlockChain 2.0 from 2013. Github Go-Ethereum. Have good future.    
[Monero] Real secret coin from 2014. Github Monero. Dangerous. Easy to be attacked. but have future.
